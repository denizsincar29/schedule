# release 1.0-beta2
## fixes:
- Fixed the schedule difference calculation, human readable outputter is now showing the correct difference. The timetable changes are now correctly shown on the program launch.
- trying to fix the issue where the program gets schedule for one more extra day while you didn't ask for it. E.g. if you ask for 3 days, it will give you 4 days. Still investigating.
